TODO list for pppd(8) LDAP plugin

 Handle radiusSimultaneousUse attribute i.e. limit number of simultaneous logins with the same user name. Functionality similar with utmp is already implemented. Enhance tools to handle logins database.

 Implement CHAP and M$CHAP/M$CHAPv2 authentication. If LDAP server holds user's password (NT or LANManager) hashes (sambaPassword, etc) use it to perform response computation. Else use {cleartext} password.

 Login date and time periods permissions management. Get information from LDAP server and compute session time limit to kick-off user.

 Set MS DNS and WINS IP addresses if they are present in LDAP response.

 Add proxyarp entry if LDAP response contains radiusProxyArp = YES (TRUE,1).

 Handle realms. If user name contains "@" perform search with ou=$realm,$basedn. Add additional option "ldapdefuserdn" which sets default baseDN to perform search.
